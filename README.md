# Market-Research-PLS-SEM-Analysis-Exploring-the-Role-of-AI-Chatbots-in-Customer-Service
This project, developed as a course project on Technopreneurial Marketing, explores the impact of AI chatbots on improving customer service. Through a quantitative research study, it analyzes how key chatbot features like ease of use, response speed, and personalization influence overall user satisfaction. The findings offer practical insights for businesses looking to leverage AI to enhance their customer experience and operational efficiency.

### Key Features
- Quantitative Research Design: The study employed a rigorous quantitative methodology to measure user experiences with chatbots.

- Structured Questionnaire: A comprehensive questionnaire was developed and refined through pilot testing to ensure the reliability and validity of constructs.

- Hypothesis Testing: Eight sub-hypotheses were formulated and tested to determine the relationship between specific chatbot features and customer satisfaction.

- Statistical Modeling: The data was analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) with SmartPLS to explore complex relationships between variables.

- Model Refinement: Constructs with low reliability, such as Trustworthiness and Accuracy, were identified and refined for the final data collection.

### Key Insights
- Drivers of Satisfaction: The research confirmed that Ease of Use, Response Speed, and Personalization are significant drivers of customer satisfaction.

- Importance of Hybrid Support: Seamless integration with human agents emerged as a critical factor for handling complex queries, proving that a hybrid approach is essential for a positive user experience.

- Challenges in Trust: Constructs related to Trustworthiness and Accuracy showed weaker reliability and a lower impact on satisfaction, suggesting that customers may currently prioritize the functionality of a chatbot over concerns about security and perfect accuracy.

- High Explanatory Power: The final model had a high RÂ² value of 0.737, indicating that 73.7% of the variance in customer satisfaction could be explained by the measured chatbot features.

### Tools & Methodology
- Statistical Software: SmartPLS for Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM).

- Data Analysis: Performed descriptive and reliability analysis (using Cronbach's Alpha, Composite Reliability, and AVE) to validate the research model.

- Primary Data Collection: Data was collected from a diverse sample of over 380 respondents, primarily students from the IIT KGP campus and urban areas in India.

#### Conclusion
This project provides actionable recommendations for businesses aiming to optimize their customer support systems. It emphasizes the need to focus on enhancing personalization and ensuring smooth transitions to human agents to boost user satisfaction and loyalty. The study also identifies areas for future research, particularly in improving the perceived trustworthiness and accuracy of AI chatbots.
